A simple Javascript Distribution To Copy A Div On Click

# Why Use it?

I have always wanted to be able to copy an element on the click of it. To do this I had to write a whole script on each page, this way, I make it easy, all that you have to do is link it using `<script src=""></script>` and add an id to the element: `<p id="copy">Hai</p>` to do this. It is a lot more simple using copythat. Especially for people who are not so great a programming, beginners. Thankyou for visiting, I appreciate this! Goodbye!
